# Lemonwood
A test harness of sorts for working with roguelike things.

I frequently encounter situations where I'd like to be able to demo something quickly, but doing so would mean a lot of painful extraction and refactoring.  This project is an attempt to make that sort of thing a lot easier so that I can do things with `examples/` that are complex and graphical.

In practice, this is likely to be a thin wrapper around BracketLib or something along those lines.
